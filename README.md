# Memory Game Project

This is a simple Card Matching Game, also known as Concentration. The player guesses which pairs of cards match. When all pairs have been found the game is over. The game provides a timer and move counter as well as a 1 to 3 star rating of the game play. The player may choose one of three different decks to play with.
